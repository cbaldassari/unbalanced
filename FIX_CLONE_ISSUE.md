# GitHub Desktop - Add Files to Existing Repository

## ✅ Your Situation
Your repository **already has files** in it (not empty).

**URL**: https://github.com/cbaldassari/unbalanced

**Solution**: Clone it anyway, then add/replace files!

## 🎯 OPTION 1: Clone Despite Warning (Recommended)

### Step 1: Clone with GitHub Desktop

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**

2. **File** → **Clone Repository**

3. Find `cbaldassari/unbalanced` in the list

4. Click **Clone**

5. **Warning appears**: "This directory is not empty"
   
   **Solution**: Choose a DIFFERENT location!
   
   Example:
   - Instead of: `Documents/GitHub/unbalanced`

   - Or: `Documents/GitHub/unbalanced-work`
   - Or: `Desktop/unbalanced`

6. Click **Clone**

✅ **Cloned!** Now you have the repository on your computer.

### Step 2: Add Your New Files

1. **Extract your ZIP** file

2. **Open TWO folders:**

   - RIGHT: Cloned repository (what GitHub Desktop just created)

3. **Drag & Drop** your files:
   - If file exists → **Replace it**
   - If file is new → **Add it**

Repeat for all files you want to remove.

### Step 3: Upload New Files

1. Click **Add file** → **Upload files**

2. **Drag & Drop** your extracted folder contents into the browser

   OR

   Click **choose your files** and select everything

3. Wait for upload...

4. Scroll down, write commit message:
   ```
   Add complete implementation
   ```

5. Click **Commit changes**

✅ **DONE!** Files uploaded via browser!

## 🎯 OPTION 3: Clone to Different Folder, Then Replace

### If you really want to use the "empty" folder:

1. **Rename** or **delete** the existing local folder (if any)

2. **Clone** to that location

3. **Add your files**

4. **Commit** and **Push**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Directory not empty" error

**Solution**: Choose a DIFFERENT location when cloning
- Not: `Documents/unbalanced`
- Use: `Documents/unbalanced-repo` (or any other name)

### Can't find cloned folder

**Solution**: In GitHub Desktop → Repository → Show in Explorer/Finder

### Upload via browser is slow

**Solution**: 
- Upload smaller files first
- Or use Option 1 (clone then add)

### Files not appearing after push

**Solution**:
- Refresh GitHub page
- Check you pushed (not just committed)
- Verify in GitHub Desktop: "Push origin" is greyed out = all pushed
